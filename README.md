The library is designed to be compatible with Unity's Burst Compiler, ensuring high-performance and low-overhead when used in conjunction with Unity's job system.


## Features

- Fixed-point arithmetic using FixNumber for deterministic calculations

- 2D fixed-point vector operations with FixVec

- Trigonometric functions using fixed-point angles

- Rotation matrix support with RotationMatrix

- Angle conversion and manipulation utilities in FixAngle

- Unity and Burst Compiler compatible


## Installation

To use iShape.FixFloat in your Unity project, follow these steps:

- Open your Unity project.
- In the top menu, select "Window" > "Package Manager".
- Click on the "+" button in the top-left corner of the Package Manager window.
- Select "Add package from git URL...".
- Enter the following URL: https://github.com/iShapeUnity/FixFloat.git
- Click the "Add" button.
- Wait for the package to be imported.
- In your C# scripts, add the following using statement to access the library:

```csharp
using iShape.FixFloat;
```


## How It Works

The \`**FixNumber**\` class uses fixed-point arithmetic to perform calculations with a high degree of precision and determinism. It supports numbers in the range 2^21 - 1 to -2^21 + 1 with a precision of 1/1024, and is most suitable for the range 10,000,000 to -10,000,000 with a precision of 0.01.

Fixed-point numbers are represented using a fixed number of bits for the fractional part. In this implementation, the number of bits representing the fractional part of the fixed-point number is 10, which allows for a precision of 1/1024 or approximately 0.001.

Here are some examples of fixed-point number representation:

- 1 / 1024 â‰ˆ 0.001 (represented as 1)
- 256 / 1024 = 0.25 (represented as 256)
- 1024 / 1024 = 1 (represented as 1024)
- (1024 + 512) / 1024 = 1.5 (represented as 1536)
- (2048 + 256) / 1024 = 2.25 (represented as 2304)

By using the \`**FixNumber**\` class, you can perform arithmetic operations using long values while maintaining the precision of floating-point numbers, ensuring deterministic behavior across different platforms and devices.


## Usage

### FixNumber

The \`**FixNumber**\` class represents a fixed-point number using a \`**long**\` as the underlying storage, allowing deterministic arithmetic operations. Use \`**FixNumber**\` for calculations instead of \`**float**\` or \`**double**\` when deterministic behavior is required. \`**FixNumber**\` provides a way to perform arithmetic operations with \`**long**\` values while maintaining the precision of floating-point numbers.

```csharp
long a = 3.14f.ToFix();
long b = 2.0f.ToFix();
long result = a * b;
float resultAsFloat = result.ToFloat();
```

### FixVec

The \`**FixVec**\` struct represents a 2D fixed-point vector, providing various utility methods and operators for vector operations. Use \`**FixVec**\` for 2D geometric calculations when deterministic behavior is required.

```csharp
FixVec vec1 = new FixVec(1.0f.ToFix(), 2.0f.ToFix());
FixVec vec2 = new FixVec(3.0f.ToFix(), 4.0f.ToFix());

FixVec sum = vec1 + vec2;
FixVec difference = vec1 - vec2;
```

### FixAngle
The \`**FixAngle**\` class provides various utility methods for working with fixed-point angles, including trigonometric functions and angle conversion.


```csharp
long angle = (Mathf.PI / 2).ToFix().RadToFixAngle();
long sin = angle.Sin();
long cos = angle.Cos();
```


## Compatibility

This library is designed to be compatible with Unity and the Burst Compiler, enabling high-performance arithmetic and geometric operations in Unity projects that utilize the job system and Burst.
